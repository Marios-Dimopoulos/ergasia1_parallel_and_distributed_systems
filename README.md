#How to run the code

Inside the Github repository i have all the source code that i used and the Makefile. So if you just type in the command line "make" there will be created 4 executables, the "seq", "omp", "cilk", "threads".
If you have in that directory the .txt file of the sparse matrix (you get that from the matlab code that is also in the github repository, which take as "input" a .mat file that you get from
"SuiteSparse matrix collection" repository and give as "output" that .txt file), you can run the code for that exact file by typing in the command line: ./"executalbel" "file".txt. I think that all the libraries
that i use are available for everyone. I didnt use anything crazy except Opemp and OpenCilk which i think it needs some downloads.

(sry for the quick README.md but i didnt have enought time to make it more accurate)
